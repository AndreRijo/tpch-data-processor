# TPC-H Data Processor

A tool that is capable of reading the tables and updates generated by TPC's dbgen tool for [TPC-H](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/), included in [TPC-H tools](https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/current_specifications5.asp).

This tool provides useful representation for the tables, including structs for each type of table but also a collection of the constants used to generate many of the fields in TPC-H's tables.

The aforementioned functionalities, implemented by the files `tableReader.go`, `tpchProc.go` and `tpchTables.go`, may prove useful for any Go program intending to implement TPC-H benchmarking or data loading.

As this tool was designed alongside the development of [PotionDB](https://github.com/AndreRijo/potionDB), the file `index.go` contains the implementation for the generation of the initial state of PotionDB's views for all of TPC-H's queries.

This tool is required by many of the repositories related with PotionDB, including [PotionDB](https://github.com/AndreRijo/potionDB), [TPCH-Client](https://github.com/AndreRijo/TPCH-Client), [TPCH-Locality-Tool](https://github.com/AndreRijo/TPCH-LocalityTool) and [PostgresTPCHClient](https://github.com/AndreRijo/postgres-tpch-client).
